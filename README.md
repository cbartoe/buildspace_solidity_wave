# buildspace_solidity_wave

The Buildspace solidity project to create a blockchain interaction with "waves", text, and front end engagement. The app will allow users to connect a wallet, enter a message, and create a transaction to "wave" to me. An option has also been added to grant a 50% chance of Rinkeby Eth being sent to the user as a random gift. 

## The Pieces
1. wavePortal.sol contract was composed in VSCode following the BuildSpace instructions
2. run.js and deploy.js were composed in VSCode as well to test and deploy the contract to the Rinkeby testnet. 
3. App.jsx and supporting files were composed in Replit as a means to import pre-made front end code and host the web app for testing and use.
