# buildspace_solidity_wave

The Buildspace solidity project to create a blockchain interaction with "waves", text, and front end engagement. 

##Beginning with HardHat and a localhost chain
1. Creating the WavePortal.sol contract, run.js, and deploy.js
2. Using HardHat to create a temporary localhost eth blockchain and running the contract. 

## Running React on Repl.it
1. Using already coded front end design forked from FarzaTV to practice working on javascript etc.


[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
